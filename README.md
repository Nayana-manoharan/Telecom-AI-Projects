# Telecom-AI-Projects
Implemented a suite of AI and ML-driven solutions to solve critical challenges in the telecom industry, improving performance, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency.


## üß† Use Cases & Solutions

### 1. üìû Call Center Optimization
- **Problem:** Manual query handling led to delays and inconsistency.
- **Solution:** GPT-based query categorization and embedding-based response matching.
- **Outcome:** Faster responses, reduced agent workload, improved support efficiency.

### 2. üîê Fraud Detection in SIM Card Usage
- **Problem:** Difficulty detecting SIM cloning and fraudulent calling patterns.
- **Solution:** Random Forest classifier using Call Detail Record (CDR) features.
- **Outcome:** Early fraud detection, reduced financial loss, improved security.

### 3. üõ°Ô∏è Network Intrusion Detection System
- **Problem:** Traditional methods fail to detect sophisticated network attacks.
- **Solution:** Trained ML models (Random Forest, SVM, Na√Øve Bayes, KNN) on NSL-KDD dataset.
- **Outcome:** Real-time binary attack detection and system security enhancement.

### 4. üë• Telecom Customer Segmentation
- **Problem:** Generic plans resulted in high churn and poor customer satisfaction.
- **Solution:** K-Means clustering on usage behavior (data, SMS, voice).
- **Outcome:** Personalized offers and better customer targeting.

### 5. üì∂ Telecom Network Optimization
- **Problem:** Network congestion, tower failures, and inefficient load balancing.
- **Solution:** 
  - K-Means clustering for congestion detection.
  - Reinforcement Learning for load distribution.
  - Random Forest & Deep Learning models for failure prediction.
- **Outcome:** Predictive maintenance, load optimization, and improved service uptime.
